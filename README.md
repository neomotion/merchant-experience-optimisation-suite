This project simulates how different types of merchants would perceive and react to a proposed user interface or product feature. It leverages AI to generate structured usability feedback, grounded in real merchant behavior and aligned with industry-standard UX principles.


**Interactive User Experience**

The user accesses an interactive web interface to:

- Describe a new feature or interface (e.g., "a mobile-optimized checkout").

- Optionally upload a mockup or design image.

- Select merchant personas that best represent the target audience (e.g., startup e-commerce brand or hybrid small business).

- Choose the type of user flow being tested (like checkout, onboarding, or dashboard).

- Navigate through three stages:

  - Create Test

  - Run Analysis

  - View Report


**Feedback Simulation**

The system simulates how selected merchant personas would perceive the feature. This includes:

- Building prompts that combine the feature description, persona traits (pain points, goals, behaviors), and relevant UX principles.

- Analyzing any uploaded image to incorporate visual context.

- Sending all of this to a large language model to generate detailed, persona-specific feedback.


**Persona-Driven Insights**

Each merchant persona is modeled with rich detail, including:

- Common business challenges (e.g., inventory issues, customer retention).

- Operational goals (e.g., scaling, automation).

- Interface preferences (e.g., simple design, fast support).

- Behavioral traits (e.g., cautious adopters vs. data-driven innovators).

These traits shape the tone, depth, and relevance of the feedback that the system generates.


**Real-World Data Grounding**

The project includes a retrieval system built from real merchant conversations. Here's how it works:

- Real-world merchant dialogues are cleaned, anonymized, and broken into chunks.

- Each chunk is transformed into an embedding (a numerical representation of the text).

- These embeddings are stored in a searchable vector database.

- When a new feature is being tested, the system searches this database for relevant past experiences and includes them as additional context for the AI.

This allows the feedback to be realistic, informed, and grounded in actual business behavior.



**Business Impact**

- Accelerated Product Development & Reduced Costs: The solution accelerates product iteration by enabling rapid user feedback simulation, reducing testing cycles from weeks to minutes. This significantly reduces UX research costs by minimizing the need for real user recruitment and traditional usability studies.

- Enhanced Product-Market Fit & Adoption: It improves feature adoption and ensures better product-market fit by aligning features with merchant-specific needs and evaluating new features through actual merchant contexts. This also enables persona-driven product design, tailoring experiences based on segment-specific behaviors.

- Improved Quality, Efficiency & Confidence: The system facilitates early risk detection by identifying flaws pre-launch, strengthens stakeholder communication with data-backed insights, and fosters knowledge retention. Ultimately, this increases team efficiency and cultivates higher confidence in launches by combining qualitative insights with quantifiable usability scores.

# **Future Improvements**

**1. Shifting from UI-centric to Holistic UX Analysis**

Currently, the system primarily analyzes design descriptions, often focusing on the User Interface (UI) elements and their direct interactions. While valuable, true product success hinges on the overall User Experience (UX). Our goal is to expand the system's analytical capabilities to encompass the entire user journey and broader context.

- Comprehensive Insights: UX goes beyond screens; it includes emotional responses, task efficiency across multiple touchpoints, and how a feature fits into a merchant's daily workflow. By focusing on UX, the analyzer can provide a more complete and nuanced understanding of pain points and delightful moments.

- Predictive Power: A holistic UX view allows for better prediction of adoption, retention, and overall merchant satisfaction, as it considers the qualitative and behavioral aspects that drive long-term engagement, not just initial click-throughs.

- Strategic Guidance: Moving beyond UI feedback allows the tool to offer more strategic guidance on product direction, identifying opportunities for innovation that improve the entire merchant experience, rather than just optimizing individual screens.

**2. Fine-tuning a Large Language Model (LLM) for Domain Expertise**

Our current RAG-based approach effectively retrieves relevant information from a knowledge base to answer queries and provide feedback. However, to achieve truly nuanced, intelligent, and contextually rich insights specific to merchant interactions, we plan to fine-tune a dedicated Large Language Model (LLM).

- Deeper Semantic Understanding: While RAG helps with retrieval, a fine-tuned LLM will develop a much deeper inherent understanding of merchant terminology, specific industry pain points, behavioral nuances, and common operational patterns. This allows it to generate feedback that is not just relevant, but truly insightful and expert-like.

- Superior Nuance and Contextual Awareness: An LLM fine-tuned on extensive merchant-specific conversational data will be able to interpret subtle cues, understand implicit needs, and provide feedback that reflects complex business scenarios, moving beyond literal interpretations of design descriptions.

- Reduced Hallucinations and Increased Factual Accuracy: By training the LLM on a curated dataset of genuine merchant interactions and verified insights, we can significantly reduce the tendency for "hallucinations" (generating plausible but incorrect information) and increase the factual accuracy of its output in the specific domain of merchant experience.

- Improved Generative Capabilities: A fine-tuned LLM can generate more coherent, actionable, and human-like feedback, potentially even offering creative solutions or identifying emergent trends that might be missed by a retrieval-only system.

- Optimized Performance: While RAG is powerful, it relies heavily on the quality of retrieved documents. Fine-tuning empowers the model itself with the domain knowledge, potentially leading to faster and more efficient insight generation for complex queries.
